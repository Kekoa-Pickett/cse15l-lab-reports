For this step, I went on the VS code app. Once I downloaded it for the MAC, I opened it and created a workspace.

To connect remotely, I had to create my own account and password. I used my school email and it worked fine but had to change it to the CS one.

I tried the ls and cat commands on my client. I canâ€™t copy or access anything because the permission is denied. To search for files, use ls -a to access hidden files.

This took me 4:06, just because I tried to log do scp after logging into ssh which gave me a message asking to permanently add a host key for IP. It will get faster the more times you do it.

Create a key using both the server and client. A key is a lot faster than typing my password, I can move files a lot faster now.

Use scp to copy the file and make sure to add ":~/" to the end. Then log in through ssh and you can run it without a password. Or you can run it in the same line that you log into ssh with.
