# Lab Report 5

I found my 2 bugs through using ```vimdiff``` on the results like suggested in the lab report. I compared both of them side by side and found two different bugs that had pretty big contrasts in answers and would be a big change. Then I looked at the md files to see if either implementation was correct.


One test with different results was test 488 which the file is [here](https://github.com/nidhidhamnani/markdown-parser/blob/main/test-files/488.html.test).
